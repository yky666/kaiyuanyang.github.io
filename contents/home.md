I am currently a second-year undergraduate student majoring in **Intelligent Science and Technology** at the **School of Intelligent Systems Engineering**, **Sun Yat-sen University**, Shenzhen Campus.

I am a member of the **General Embodied Intelligence Center** (通用具身智能中心), supervised by [Prof. Xiaodan Liang](https://lemondan.github.io/). My current research focuses on **Embodied AI** and **Humanoid Robots**, specifically bridging the gap between high-level semantic understanding (VLM/VLA) and low-level whole-body control (MPC/WBC).
